 Smooth, sleek, responsive and retina ready confetti animation effect. There are two types of confetti, the traditional pieces of ‘paper’ and a ribbon type that wiggles its way down the screen. The ribbon confetti uses a physics simulation for the motion while the paper confetti is animated using sine functions.
